# Papers:
# There are two different types of papers. Papers with laws which you stamp, or newspapers which are there to provide you with information on whats going on in your country.

# Stamps:
# You can use the stamps to make your own judgements on whether you want to accept or deny laws. Your own judgements can either leave you with a good or a bad outcome at the end of the week.

# Bell:
# Ring the bell when you are ready to start either the next day or the in-between day. The in-between day will include your newspaper for the day. The next day will provide you new papers to stamp.
